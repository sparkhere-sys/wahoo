# Contributing

if you'd like to contribute, feel free to do so! just follow these basic guidelines:

- **use pull requests** like a normal human being. *don't just randomly commit to main unless its a small change like fixing a typo.*
- if you're fixing a bug, **_describe_ what it did**, and **_how_ you fixed it** so everyone can be on the same page. *and maybe add comments but thats your call honestly*
- just don't be a dick. the [code of conduct](https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/wahoo/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) exists for a reason.
- remember that this has the [MIT license](https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/wahoo/blob/main/LICENSE). modified, sure, but its the MIT license at the end of the day.
- if you're contributing to `module/`, don't submit a pull request to `main`. if that doesn't make sense, then just don't press "Compare and pull request" when you're on GitHub's web interface.

thanks for contributing.
