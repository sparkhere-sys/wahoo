# Contributing

if you'd like to contribute, feel free to do so! just follow these basic guidelines:

- **use pull requests** for major changes. *don't just randomly commit to main unless its a small change like fixing a typo.*
- if you're fixing a bug, **_describe_ what it did**, and **_how_ you fixed it** so everyone can be on the same page. *and maybe add comments but thats your call honestly*
- just don't be a dick. the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) exists for a reason.
- (optional) make funny commit messages *because we deserve to laugh while we suffer*

thanks for contributing.
