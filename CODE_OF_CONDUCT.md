***Be excellent to each other.*** No harassment, discrimination, or toxic behavior allowed. Period. If you want to dick around and mess with people, go to Reddit.

Play nice, respect everyoneâ€™s contributions, and keep it friendly. If someone crosses the line, please report it to the maintainers.

Have fun, create cool stuff, and stay positive. That's all.
